# forKernels

**Tiny libraries. Massive performance. Runs anywhere.**

forKernels is a portable ecosystem of high-performance computing kernels that fit on any device and plug into any language. From a Raspberry Pi to a Jetson to a cloud VM — same library, same API, same speed.

---

### Small Enough to Ship Anywhere

Each module is a single lightweight native library — typically **under 2 MB** — with a clean C ABI that works with any language or runtime that can call a function pointer.

**Python. C++. Rust. C#. JavaScript. Swift. Go. Java. Anything.**

No frameworks. No runtimes. No dependencies. Just drop in a library and call it.

### Runs on Everything

| ✅ | Device |
|---|--------|
| 🤖 | NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano / Thor |
| 🍓 | Raspberry Pi 5 |
| 🕶️ | Wearables & smart glasses |
| 💻 | Laptops & desktops (x86, ARM) |
| ☁️ | Cloud VMs (AWS, GCP) |
| 🌐 | Browsers (WASM) |

One library. Every platform. No rewrite.

### What's Inside

17+ specialized kernel libraries spanning:

| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🧠 AI & ML | 📷 Computer Vision | 🎮 3D & Simulation | 📡 Signal Processing |
| 📈 Financial Computing | 🧬 Bioinformatics | 🧭 Navigation & SLAM | 🎲 Bayesian Inference |
| ⚡ Optimizers | 🔢 Linear Algebra | 📊 FFT & Transforms | 💾 Async I/O |

Use one module or all of them. They're independent, composable, and designed to work together.

### Fast

| Benchmark | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| 100K particle fluid simulation | **122 FPS** on edge hardware |
| Financial time-series (SMA) | **1,962×** faster than pandas |
| 3D mesh transforms | **16–24×** faster than JS |
| Real-time CV pipeline | **All targets met** on Jetson Orin Nano |

### Get It

Available on **AWS Marketplace** and **Google Cloud Marketplace**.

| Tier | |
|------|---|
| **Free** | Core math and FFT kernels |
| **Pro** | All modules, Python bindings |
| **Enterprise** | Source access, custom deployment, priority support |

Device licensing available for embedded, robotics, and edge deployment.
